Zope3 Application, Instance and Offline Recipes
***********************************************

Recipes for creating Zope 3 instances with distinguishing features:

- Don't use a skeleton

- Separates application and instance definition

- Don't support package-includes

- Support offline instance.

Unfortunately, partial Windows support at this time.  It works but it's alpha.
