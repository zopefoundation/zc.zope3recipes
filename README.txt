**************************************
Zope3 Application and Instance Recipes
**************************************

Recipes for creating Zope 3 instances with distinguishing features:

- Don't use a skeleton

- Separates application and instance definition

- Don't support package-includes

Unfortunately, partial Windows support at this time. It works but it's alpha.
